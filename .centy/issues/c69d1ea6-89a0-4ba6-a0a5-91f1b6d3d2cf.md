# Enforce 100% test coverage with CI check on every push

Implement and enforce 100% test coverage across the entire codebase, with automated CI checks on every push.

## Requirements

### Test Coverage Setup

* Add `cargo-tarpaulin` or `cargo-llvm-cov` for coverage measurement
* Configure coverage to fail if below 100%
* Add coverage configuration to `Cargo.toml` or dedicated config file

### CI Integration

* Add GitHub Actions workflow for coverage checks
* Run coverage on every push and PR
* Block merges if coverage drops below 100%
* Display coverage badge in README

### Coverage Reports

* Generate HTML coverage reports for local development
* Upload coverage reports as CI artifacts
* Consider integration with Codecov or similar service

## Acceptance Criteria

* All modules have 100% line coverage
* CI fails if any uncovered code is introduced
* Coverage reports are easily accessible
* New code contributions must include tests
