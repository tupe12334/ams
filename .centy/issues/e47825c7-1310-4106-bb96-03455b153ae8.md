# Split CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE sections from README

Extract the Contributing section and License section from README.md into separate files:

1. Create CONTRIBUTING.md with the current Contributing section content (prerequisites, pre-commit hooks, running checks manually)
1. Create LICENSE file with the MIT license text (currently just says ‘MIT’ in README)
1. Update README.md to link to these new files instead of containing the full content

This follows common open source conventions and keeps the README focused on project overview and usage.
